VMware bridged connection fix

*Note* If you can get a connection on NAT but not bridged, it's most likely because you're defaulting to the wrong NIC. Below are the steps to fix.

Steps:
1) In VMware's interface, select Edit > Virtual Network Editor
2) escalate privileges to change teh settings
3) Select your bridged NIC (most likely VMnet0)
4) Set the "Bridged to: Automatic" to your appropriate NIC (Ethernet example: Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller. Wireless Example: Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC)
5) Ok & restart networking service!
