Setting up Squid on pfsense as a cache proxy

1) install and setup pfsense and log into web GUI
2) System > package manager > available packages > find "Squid"
3) Services > Proxy Server > Local Cache tab
4) Change "Hard Disk Cache Size" - I set to 10gb or (10000 mb)	
5) Change "Maximum Object Size" - I set to 512 mb
6) Change "Memeory Cache Size" - I set to 512 mb
7) Ensure "Cache Dynamic Content" check box is checked
8) Go back to the General tab and enable squid by checking the checkbox, "Enable Squid Proxy"
9) Disable "Keep Settings/Data", if you're reinstalling or uninstalling, typically you want to have a clean start but if you're upgrading, you might want to leave this checked
10) Enable "Transparent HTTP Proxy"  
11) Check "Enable Access Logging"
12) [Optional] Change Hostname - if changed, make sure to change the email to match the hostname. Ex: hostname = localhost; email: admin@localhost
