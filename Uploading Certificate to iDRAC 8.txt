1. Login
2. On the left column, iDRAC Settings > Network
3. On the tabs towards the top, select SSL
4. Select Generate CSR > Next
5. Fill in accordingly
    - Comman Name: Enter the FQDN (e.g. server-01)
    - Subject Altenrative Names (SAN): (e.g. server-01,192.168.1.1) // no space, comma-separated. It correctly handles IPs vs. FQDN
        - if SAN isn't available, fill in what is avaiable and this will be addressed in step 7
6. Generate // downloads CSR (<30s)
7. Submit to Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (or whatever your CA is)
    - If you are using MS Certificate services and you could not fill in the SAN in the iDRAC UI, then create a certificate and fill in the following for the Attributes: san:dns=server-01&ipaddress=192.168.1.1
8. Download the certificate as BASE64
9. Go to SSL Main Menu > Select Upload Server Certificate
10. Upload the base64 server certificate > Apply > reset iDRAC (~3m to complete restart) > verify certificate is active (if you're using the lock as a reference, you might have to create another tab or window for it to update.)

Upload private key to iDRAC
1. Generate the private + CSR + public key via openssl on another machine.
2. Have access to the iDRAC CLI, RACADM. This is available via OpenManage Enterprise/Essentials or can be downloaded standalone. This guide still use the standalone version.
3. The command is: racadm -r [IPv4 of iDRAC] -i sslkeyupload -t 1 --nocertwarn -f C:\location\of\.key
    - -r = IPv4 address of target
    - -i = interactive prompt for username and password. This might not work with OpenManage Enterprise and might require -u [username] and -p [password]
    - -f = file we are uploading
    -  If you're using OpenManage Enterprise, enter the command while omitting the "racadm" portion - -r [IPv4 of iDRAC] -i sslkeyupload -t 1 --nocertwarn -f C:\location\of\.key
4. Upload the certificate generated by the CA (BASE64)
    - racadm -r [IPv4 of iDRAC] -i sslcertupload -t 1 -f c:\idrac_web.cer
5. Reset iDRAC
    - racadm -r [IPv4 of IDRAC] -i --nocertwarn racreset
6. After ~3m, verify the cert is working via a Web Browser
