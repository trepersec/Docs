~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FreeBSD beginner setup on raspberrypi 3 B+ - arm64 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

1) download - https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/arm64/aarch64/ISO-IMAGES/12.0/FreeBSD-12.0-RELEASE-arm64-aarch64-RPI3.img.xz

2) burn to sd card

3) mine booted directly into a login page

"FreeBSD/arm64 (generic) (ttyv0)

login:"

    - username: root
    - password: root
4) change root password
    - # passwd root
5) setup timezone
    - Options:
        - # tzsetup
        - # date yymmddhhmmss
        - # cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime
    - check with: # date

* NOTE* Typically you would do "# freebsd-update fetech" but as of now, freebsd doesn't fully support arm. So we just continue setting up FreeBSD

6) # pkg update
    - you'll be prompted to install the package manager which will grab all the latest and greatest.
    - Perform "# pkg update" to assure of updates
7) # pkg upgrade

8) install nano, bash, bash_completion if you want
    - # pkg search bash
    - # pkg install bash_completion-x.x*        // whatever version you see. It will also install the latest bash version
9) setup ssh    *By default, ssh is enable and running for some but if not then
    - # ls /etc/ssh                 // search for *.pub files
    - # vi /etc/rc.conf             // check if "sshd_enabled" is set to "YES" or "NO" and change accordingly
    - # reboot
    - # service -e | grep "ssh"     // you should see the ssh daemon
        - # service sshd onestart   // to start the daemon
    - connect!
10) install sudo
    - # pkg install sudo
11) create a user with privleges
    - # sudo adduser
    - Even though I set for the user to have admin privileges, I still had to add it to the sudoers file:
        - # vi /usr/local/etc/suoders
            - or # visudo
        -  Append after "root ALL=(ALL) ALL"
            user ALL=(ALL) ALL
        - save
        - Method 2 - appending to the wheel group:
            - # pw groupmod wheel -M user
            - # vi /usr/local/etc/suoders
                - or # visudo
            - uncomment "# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL"

12) Networking
    - I have two interfaces so my first will be my WAN link via DHCP (ue0) and my second will be my LAN link set statically (ue1)
    - Static IP address
        - # vi /etc/rc.conf
            - Original:
                hostname="generic"
                ifconfig_DEFAULT="DHCP"
                sshd_enable="YES"
                sendmail_enable="NONE"
                sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
                sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
                sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
                growfs_enable="YES"
            - Adjusted:
                hostname="generic"
                ifconfig_ue0="DHCP"
                ifconfig_ue1="inet 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.248"
                defaultrouter="192.168.1.1"
                sshd_enable="YES"
                sendmail_enable="NONE"
                sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
                sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
                sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
                growfs_enable="YES"
            - # service netif restart
            - # service routing restart
    - DNS
        - # vi /etc/resolv.conf
            - Set your dns server(s) accordingly. I already have upstream done through dhcp so I just appended google as my second DNS
            - nameserver 8.8.8.8

13) Change hostname
    - could of done this in the networking step above but that would be so disorganized
    - # vi /etc/rc.conf
        - Original:
            hostname="generic"
        - Adjusted
            hostname="raspbsd"
