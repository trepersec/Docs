	- Grafana is most similar to Kibana, in that it's a front-end for the stack it's serving (it was essentially built to be the Kibana for metrics), but they're not comparable products.
TICK Stack:
	- Works with dockers and kubernetes
	- visualization
	- used for different purpose than ELK stack. ELK used for logs, individual events while TICK stack is used for metrics
	- can implement to send metrics to ELK
	- store numeric time-series data
Prometheus: nope
	- does not log or not scalable
	
Opentsdb: (found through grafana
	- scalable (runs on hadoop and hbase)
	- visualization- 

Graphite:
	- store numeric time-series data
Collectd:
	- Unix daemon that collects, transfers and stores performance data of computers and network equipment
