# additional comments

Prerequisites:
0.  $ apt update
    $ apt full-upgrade # only do this if you are at the upmost version of your OS. Ex: if you're running Ubuntu 16 while Ubuntu 18 is out, it will upgrade to 18. If you want to avoid this, do "apt upgrade"
    $ apt-get install default-jdk #installing java for step 3.
    $ sudo -s       # this is the shortcut I use to not use "sudo *" for every line but don't use this regularly. It's better to make a habit of doing "sudo *" because "sudo -s" gives you an entirely new root shell and doesn't make sense to do this just for two lines of code. 

1. Download from http://molo.ch/index.html#downloads
    - $ wget https://files.molo.ch/moloch-master_ubuntu16_amd64.deb # ubuntu 16
    - $ wget https://files.molo.ch/moloch-master_ubuntu18_amd64.deb # ubuntu 18
    - $ wget https://files.molo.ch/moloch-master.centos7.x86_64.rpm # centos 7
2. $ sudo dpkg -i moloch*.deb
3. $ sudo /data/moloch/bin/Configure
4. $ vi /usr/share/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml  # user level
     OR 
5. $ vi /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml # root level
    # uncomment the ip address ("network.host: <ip>")and port and set it to your ip address and leave the port at 9200
5.1 $ sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service 
    OR 
   $ sudo service elasticsearch start
5.2 $ vi /data/moloch/etc/config.ini
    # you will need to change the ip address and port to the ones to configured above because it is, by-default, set to localhost (127.0.0.1), which will cause errors moving forward
    
6. $ /data/moloch/db/db.pl http://<ip address>:9200 init
7. Add admin user
    $ /data/moloch/bin/moloch_add_user.sh admin  <password> --admin 
        # make sure to keep the quotes and only replace <stuff> 
8. $ sudo systemctl start molochcapture.service
    $ sudo systemctl start molochviewer.service   

    # OR #

    $ sudo service molochcapture start && service molochviewer start
9. # Check for errors
    $ sudo service molochcapture status
    $ sudo service molochviewer status
    $ less /data/moloch/logs/viewer.log         # this had one line for me
    $ less /data/moloch/logs/capture.log        # this was filled    

10. # visit the web GUI via URL: http://<ip_adress>:8005
    # fill in previous credentials and BOOM DONE!

11. OPTION -- add services to start on startup
    $ sudo systemctl enable molochcapture.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable molochviewer.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service

    # Adding as a service note! #
    # I tried using updeate-rc.d but it wasn't working. Plus, molochcapture and molochviewer are not in /etc/init.d and don't have scripts for them so you would have to create your own. Just follow the above.

    # reboot and check for status #
    $ reboot
    $ service elasticsearch status
    $ service moloch* status
    
    Problem:
    - service molochcapture status = "Failed to start Moloch Capture"
        # have yet to find an automated soltuion. What does fix it is restarting the service.

# Another optional addition #
If this is on a sole system sitting between two devices, follow the guide the link to setup the server as a router
https://opensourceforu.com/2015/04/how-to-configure-ubuntu-as-a-router/

To enable IP forwarding:
1) $ sudo sh -c echo 1 /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2)  Edit /etc/sysctl.conf
   # Uncomment "net.ipv4.ip forward=1"
3) setup iptables (from https://superuser.com/questions/767406/how-to-forward-traffic-using-iptables-rules)

EXT=ens33
INT=ens38
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward #Tell the system it is OK to forward IP packets
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $EXT -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i $EXT -o $INT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i $INT -o $EXT -j ACCEPT
ip addr show $INT

4) Save iptables
    $ iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules
