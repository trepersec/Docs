Uploading certificate to IIS


1. Generate the CSR, private key, and retrieve the new server's public certificate and root ca chain from the CA (DER format or BASE64/PEM is fine) > Convert the server's public ceritificate to pfx to upload to the Windows Server
    - openssl req -nodes -sha256 -out /tmp/request.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /tmp/serverkey.key -extensions v3_req -subj "/C=US/ST=[State]/L=[City]/O=[Org]/OU=[OU]/CN=[FQDN]" -reqexts SAN -config <(cat /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf < (printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=IP:[IPaddr],DNS:[FQDN],DNS:[FQDN].domain.com))

    - convert from BASE64 to pfx
        - openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey serverkey.key -in server-cert.cer
        - The Export Password is used to protect the file and is required to upload to Windows.
1. Open IIS Manager (inetmgr)
2. Select the server (not the site) to modify
3. Find and select Server Certificates
4. On the right-pane, find and select, "Create Certificate Request..." > Fill accordingly
5. Set bit length to 2048+
6. Submit the request to the CA and include the Subject Alternate Names
    - in MS AD Certificate Services: Ex - san:dns=wsus&ipaddress=192.168.1.1&dns=wsus.domain.com
