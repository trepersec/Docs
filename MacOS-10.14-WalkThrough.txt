I used this on a throwaway machine with data I don't mind losing/wiping in case of infection!

Steps:
1) Download the following items:
    - Mac ISO - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tCqH1rkw9YXOs--UXcY5RmsE_RRuXJYx/view
    - VMware Unlocker 2.1.1 - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Eqsl9MKX8pSk9lNWtpckFZM1k/view
        - This is somehow needed for the MacOS to actually load.
        - It also adds Mac to the list of available VMs on VMware.
2) Set up the VM in VMware (Do NOT start the VM)
    - Allocate appropriate resources based off use
        - I'm using this to get more familiar with the Mac interface and being able to navigate. When troubleshooting for other people, I ran into the issue of not knowing where things are and having to rely on the user to tell me where things like the settings are.
        - I purposfully overprevisioned for a smoother time and I typically only have one VM running on this machine.
        - 100GB Stoage (HDD), 2 Processors & 2 Cores per processor = 4 total, 8GB Memory
    - Do NOT start the VM
3) Edit the .vmx
    - Locate the directory the VM is stored
    - Open the .vmx file in your favorite text editor (i use Visual Studio but others like notepad, notepad++, atom, and sublime are perfectly acceptable)
    - Append the following text:
        smc.version="0"
    - Save & Exit
4) Start the VM
5) Set up your Mac as preferred (takes around 30 minutes. Varies depending on resources given)
    - (optional) Before clicking "Install MacOS", the video changed the HDD name so...Click "Disk Utility"1
        - Select the HDD(s) that you want to name change (notice the storage you allocated previously but the name is something like "VMware Virtual SATA Hard Drive Media")
        - At the top, select "Erase" and rename. Click Erase.
        - Exit this menu and proceed to install the MacOS.

You've made it to the Desktop! Now for the finishing touches..

6) Eject any CDs on the Desktop
    - right-click and select "Eject"
7) Add VMware tools
    - Doing this the normal way (through Vmware's interface) won't work. It'll show that it's added, but you won't receive the benefits.
    - Instead, within the VMware Unlocker, there is another ISO that'll do this for us (again, be way of the information you put in this system because there's a lot of suspicious inputs that we can't vet)
    - Use the shortcut outside of the VM, Ctrl + D, to open up the VM's settings.
    - Go to the "CD/DVD (SATA)" device, know where your VMware Unlocker folder is and change the ISO image to the following, "VMwareUnlocker2.1.1\tools\dawin.iso"
    - Connect it by clicking the check box or if it doesn't pop up, go to the bottom right hand corner of the VMware interface and right-click the CD icon and click "Connect".
    - Install VMware tools through the GUI
    - Restart
    - (optional) Go back into the VM settings and REMOVE the "CD/DVD (SATA)" device if you don't plan on using it.
Done!
