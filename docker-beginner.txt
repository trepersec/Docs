Docker on PI

Install Docker
    # curl -sSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh

    // this is an automated installation script provided by docker

Add docker group
    #   sudo groupadd docker     // create "docker" group
    #   sudo gpasswd -a <user> docker   // add <user> to docker group
    #   newgrp docker   // enable the group as the user you're under
    
    // This isn't necessarily but this is so we don't have to run "sudo docker ..." all the time


A few other noob commands
    # docker ps     // shows your current live containers
    # docker ps -a  // see all containers ran and currently running
    # docker version    // version information
    # docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello there!    // another image similar to "hello-world". This actually gave me the error, "standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error" and this is becuase the image pulled wasn't packaged for the raspberry pi architecture (ARM).
    # docker images     // images stored locally
    # docker run -d -p 80:80 hypriot/rpi-busybox-httpd      // creates an accessible web server
        # docker ps     // view the live image
        # docker kill <container ID>    // kill the image
        # docker ps     // check if its still there


Build our first image

Make the image available on Docker Hub
// Docker hub is like GitHub; everyone openly posts their images
    # docker tag <container ID> <dockerHub username>/<your image name>:latest
    # docker push <username>/<image name>

Remove local images
    # docker rmi <username>/<container name>
        - example
            # docker rmi hello-world:latest   // you can "docker rmi <TAB>" to see what's available

Pull vs run
    # docker pull <username>/<container name>   
    // This downloads the image from the Hub but doesn't run it

    # docker run <username>/<container
    // This searches locally for the image and then searches the hub if not found. Once finished downloading, it will run it.

Learning about docker foundations
- Docker file
    - a standardized file structure needed to build a docker image.
    - generates containers that can be stopped, destroyed, and rebuilt

- building our first image
    # mkdir myproject && cd myproject
    # echo "hello" > hello
    # echo -e "FROM busybox\nCOPY /hello /\nRUN cat /hello" > Dockerfile
    # docker build -t helloapp:v1 .
