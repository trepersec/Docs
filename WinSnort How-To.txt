http://www.winsnort.com/tutorials/article/4-installing-an-apache2-web-server-logging-events-to-a-mysql-database/

(1) Download the files in the article and unzip everything
(2) dism.exe /online /enable-feature /all /featurename:NetFX3 /Source:C:\sources\sxs
(3) Go into the 'moddler.vbs' file and change the source/location according to environment
(4) Run Snort_installer
(5) open up snort > snort -W > snort -V -i [from -W] > if working, ctrl + C
(6) tartool (or 7zip) C:\[path]\snortrules.snapshot.x.tar.gz C:\Snort
(7) Run strawberry perl installer
(8) Move the apache file to C:\Snort\Apache, barnyard2 into C:\Snort\barnyard2, adodb5 into C:\Snort\adodb5, php 
	to C:\Snort\php
	Place the seperate module (.so) in the C:\Snort\Apache\modules folder
(9) Move the base file to C:\Snort\Apache\htdocs\base
(10) Start mysql installer > "Choosing a setup type" menu--Custom > 
	"Select Products and Feature"--1. MySQL Servers>MySQL Sever>MySQL Sever 5.7>x64> move to right side
	2. Select the one item on the right, click advanced options, change directory to C:\Snort\mySQL >
	next>execute>next>"Type and Networking"--Config Type: Server Machine>next>type password>next>rename service name as MySQL>next>execute>complete>
	Afterwards, cmd>"copy C:\Snort\mySQL\lib\libmysql.dll C:\Windows\system32"
(11) In the activators folder, alter the .bat files to your environment. 
(12) Move the activators folder AND the create-sidmap folder into Snort and then cmd>"perl C:\Snort\create-sidmap\create-sidmap.pl C:\Snort\rules\ > C:\Snort\etc\sid-msg.map"
(13) Create white_list.rules and black_list.rules by right-clicking or "type NUL > C:\Snort\rules\white_list.rules" && "type NUL > C:\Snort\rules\black_list.rules"

Rules that will alert on Flash contained within an Excel file and things like that. This policy contains everything that is in Connectivity, and Balanced.
