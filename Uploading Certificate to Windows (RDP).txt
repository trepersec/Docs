Uploading Certificate to Windows (RDP)

1. Generate the CSR, private key, and retrieve the new server's public certificate and root ca chain from the CA (DER format or BASE64/PEM is fine) > Convert the server's public ceritificate to pfx to upload to the Windows Server
    - convert from BASE64 to pfx
        -openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey serverkey.key -in server-cert.cer
        - The Export Password is used to protect the file and is required to upload to Windows.
2. Go to the Certificate authority and open the configuration settings
    - Right-click certificate template > Manage 
    - Right-click Computer > Duplicate template
        - Subject Name tab:
            - Subject name format = common name
            - Select DNS name checkbox
        - General tab:
            - Adjust validity period accordingly (e.g. 5 years)
            - Select the checkbox, publish certificate in AD
            - Set the name (e.g. RemoteDesktopSecure)
        - Security tab:
            - Enable read and enroll permissions for the group that is allowed to issue certificates (e.g. Domain Admins)
        - Extensions tab:
            - Edit > Delete the 2 default polices (i.e. client & server authen) > Add > New > Name the policy (e.g. Remote Desktop Authentication) > set the OID to 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.54.1.2 > OK > OK > OK > OK
    - Go back to the Certificate Authority configuration console > Right-click Certificate Templates > New > Certificate Template to Issue > Find and select your newly created template > OK
3. Create the GPO
    - Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Server Authentication Certificate Template 
        - Enable
        - Add the template name we created (e.g. RemoteDesktopSecure)
    - Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Security\Require use of specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections 
        - Enable
        - Set to SSL

4. Update
5. Restart Remote Desktop Configuration service (RDCS)
6. [optional] verify certificates in certlm.msc
    - The new cert should be present in the following locations
        - Personal > certificates
        - Remote Desktop > Certificates
    - The CA Cert should be present in the following location
        - Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates 

Troubleshooting (RDP Warnings when connecting to host):
- A revocation check could not be performed for the certificate
    - ?
- The certificate or associated chain is invalid (Code: 0x10000)
    - The CA cert is not installed on the local machine. Download the CA's cert and install it to the local machine.
